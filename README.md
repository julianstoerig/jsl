# JSL

is a set of non-performance oriented (although I sincerely attempt to avoid pessimisation),
strictly **C99** utilities which I often want in my programs, but which the C standard library
does not provide attractive alternatives for.

Since I want to use these in a variety of projects with varying legal status, I decided to
[UNLICENSE](https://www.unlicense.org) them.

# Contributions

Due to the challenges imposed by copyright law, I do not accept patches
written by somebody else. If you would like to report a bug or ask for a
feature to be implemented, it is still useful for me if you append a patch,
but do not be annoyed if I fully rewrite it myself.
